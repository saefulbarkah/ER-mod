1. Place the regulation file you want to edit into the input folder.
-If you already have a mod that edits the regulation file, use that one
-Otherwise use the regulation file from you "ELDEN RING/Game" folder

2. Run the Grass Editor.exe
-If it doesn't start or instantly closes, make sure you have the .NET Desktop Runtime 8 installed.

3. Select multipliers for each category
> -1: use my recommended setting
> 0: skip this category
> 1: reset this category to the vanilla value
> *: your custom multiplier (values will get clamped automatically)

4. The edited regulation file will appear in the output folder.
!!I highly recommend using mod engine instead of overwriting the one in your game folder.

Optional:
Endorse the mod, report bugs or give feedback.
